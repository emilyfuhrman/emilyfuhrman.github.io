My name is Emily Fuhrman. I am a data visualization designer and developer based in Brooklyn, New York. This site explores critical approaches to visualization, mapping, and data-driven design.

My work has been acknowledged by WIRED, Scientific American, and the Columbia University Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities.
