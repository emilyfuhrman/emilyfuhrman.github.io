#### My name is Emily Fuhrman. I am a freelance data visualization designer and developer based in Brooklyn, New York. 

#### In addition to freelance work, I now run [Arc Lab](http://arclab.co), which began in 2015 as a multidisciplinary, experimental practice focused on research, collaboration, and data-driven visual systems.

#### My work has been acknowledged by WIRED, Scientific American, and the Columbia University Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities.
