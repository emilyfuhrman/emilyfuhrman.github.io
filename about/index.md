My name is Emily Fuhrman. I am a data artist and data visualization developer based in Brooklyn, New York. I explore critical approaches to creating beauty and meaning through data.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I currently work at Two Sigma, and teach data visualization at Columbia University School of Professional Studies. My work has been acknowledged by WIRED, Scientific American, and the Columbia University Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities.
