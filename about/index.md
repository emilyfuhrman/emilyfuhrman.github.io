My name is Emily Fuhrman. I am a data artist based in Brooklyn, New York. I explore critical approaches to creating beauty and meaning through information visualization.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I currently work at Two Sigma and teach data visualization at Columbia University. My work has been acknowledged by WIRED, Scientific American, and the Columbia University Group for Experimental Methods in Humanistic Research.
