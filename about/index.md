My name is Emily Fuhrman. I am a data artist based in <span class='st'>New York</span> London. My work explores data as a critical medium.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I currently work at Two Sigma. I previously taught data visualization and mapping at Columbia University. My work has been acknowledged by WIRED, Scientific American, and the Columbia University Group for Experimental Methods in Humanistic Research.
