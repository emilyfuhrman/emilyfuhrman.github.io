My name is Emily Fuhrman. I am a data visualization designer and developer based in Brooklyn, New York. I explore critical approaches to creating beauty and meaning through data.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I currently work at Two Sigma, and teach visualization at Columbia's School of Professional Studies. My work has been acknowledged by WIRED, Scientific American, and the Columbia University Group for Experimental Methods in the Humanities.
