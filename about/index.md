My name is Emily Fuhrman. I am a data artist based in <span class='st'>New York</span> London. My work explores data as a critical medium.<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I currently work at Two Sigma, and previously taught data visualization and mapping at Columbia University. I also write [Visual Research](https://visualresearch.substack.com/), which explores structured ways of understanding the physical world.
