_Side-view States_ is an atlas visualizing every U.S. state from the side. 

Viewed from above, U.S. state boundaries enclose flat polygons, which differently approximate gridlines, follow natural barriers, or abut the ocean in a jagged edge. "[I]nfinitely thin"[1], geopolotical boundaries represent the legal and subsequent cultural definitions of where one territory ends and another begins.

The traveler between U.S. states tends to experience state borders in a pointed, embodied way — such as hearing a programmed welcome announcement through a personal GPS system when crossing from New York to New Jersey, or looking across the Ohio River to Kentucky.

On each page, a different state is programmatically lifted from the physical terrain, then tilted to collapse the space its boundaries enclose. 

Floating as such, visually disconnected, the border becomes the fragile trace of the land underneath it, ineffectual at containing, by human fiat, the multitudinous complexity of its topography, culture, population.

A border is and is not more than a line.
