_“...in ordinary speech there is a slippage between ‘within this region/area/territory’ and ‘within these boundaries/limits/ borders’, pointing to the ease with which we can pass between thinking in terms of regions and thinking in terms of boundaries.”_
&mdash;Gaston

On maps of the United States, state boundaries enclose flat polygons, independent of the ground beneath. Viewed from above, the borders between state territories differently follow natural barriers, approximate the juncture of a grid, and mark the edges of the land that abuts the ocean. The lines that define them trace two-dimensional outlines not subject to the vagaries of terrain, representing instead the legal and subsequent cultural definitions of where one territory ends and another begins.

The traveler between U.S. states tends to experience state borders in a pointed, embodied way — such as hearing a programmed welcome announcement through a personal GPS system when crossing from New York to New Jersey, or looking across the Ohio River to Kentucky. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the concept of statehood became fragile, almost ridiculous, in contrast to the hyper-localized geography to which I and others confined ourselves. State boundaries, already an abstract concept, served primarily as grouping methods for daily statistics detailing the presence and progression of the virus.

In this project, I explore cultural boundaries as data-driven artifacts unmoored from direct experience. _Side-view States_ is an atlas of state boundaries given spatial heft, programmatically lifted from the physical terrain, then rotated to collapse the space they enclose. Floating as such, visually unmoored, the border becomes the fragile trace of the land underneath it, ineffectual at containing, by human fiat, the multitudinous complexity of its topography, culture, population.
