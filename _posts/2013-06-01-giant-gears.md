A series of large-scale, hand-inked, gear-like images. You may recognize the original from [this](/projects/gallery-of-cool-mistakes.html) post, which was a screenshot taken from a Processing sketch. Each circle measures about 20 inches across. My original intent was to create an analog rendition of an algorithmic image, which morphed into a few different iterations.
