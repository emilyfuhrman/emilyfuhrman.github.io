An experiment in mapping daily routes without using geographic coordinates. 

The shapes comprising each diagram represent the spaces between locations, and are determined by two things: the mode(s) of transportation used to get from one place to the next, and the loudness or softness of the second place in comparison to the first. 

Each diagram is drawn from the bottom up, starting with the earliest location visited. The width of each shape is determined by the number of minutes traveled by train, while the height of each shape is determined by the number of minutes traveled on foot. A shape that 'leans' to the right represents a move to a louder location. A shape that leans to the left represents a move to a softer one. Width, height, and orientation are relative to the top edge of the preceding shape. Most of the time, it took a combination of train and walking to get from one place to another. 

Data culled from January 8th, 9th, and 10th, 2015. Isometric inspiration from Fred Sandback's 1977 _Ten Isometric Drawings for Ten Vertical Constructions_.
