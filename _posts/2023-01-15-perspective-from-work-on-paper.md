Dominant forms of geographic representation make public space legible: the patterns of commuters through transit systems; the networks of roads between towns; the footprints of buildings in a city grid. Interior spaces seem comparatively <i>un</i>-mapped, even insulated from the forces that operationalize the world visible by satellite or Google Street View. 

The interior of any building, including the personal space of the home, is not strictly private. Smartphones, vacuum cleaners, and security devices&mdash;to name a few&mdash;take notes on the arrangement of furniture, the floorplan, the movements of the inhabitants of the home. 

This piece mobilizes and makes visible the memory of an object in the lived interior, capturing the edges of a room as 'seen' by a print positioned in a frame. The vertical lines mark the top and bottom corners of the edges of the surrounding walls, scaled according to their actual distance from the framed print.

Thanks to Nic Flood for insight and measurement methodology.
