A series of [four data-driven animations](https://www.electricobjects.com/collections/67) commissioned by [Electric Objects](https://www.electricobjects.com/). Each piece incorporates data related to the common blackbird: habitat classification, wing feather distribution, global occurrence, and call frequency. The series, entitled _Merula_, is specially composed for display on the [Electric Objects EO1](http://shop.electricobjects.com/).

View (and display) the full collection [here](https://www.electricobjects.com/collections/67). Read an accompanying interview with me [here](http://zine.electricobjects.com/interviews/emily-fuhrman).
