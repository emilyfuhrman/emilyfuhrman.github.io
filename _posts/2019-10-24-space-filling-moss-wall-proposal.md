Proposal for a pixelized moss wall designed to fill the interior space of a stairwell.

The design is the product of unraveling and 're'-raveling the graphical artifacts of a company's brand identity. Here, the Two Sigma logo is programmatically traversed, pixel-by-pixel, using a Hilbert curve. The curve is next unraveled, snakelike, revealing an array of hues. The hues are devised to be rendered in cubes of moss, bringing greenery into the space.
