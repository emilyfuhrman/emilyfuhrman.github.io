V's, rather. Basically what you get when you cross an echo chamber of constraints with sumi ink.

Each V is annotated based on its position with respect to the others. Relative to orientation, a vertical stroke down the center means the V is diagonal to one facing the opposite direction, a horizontal stroke across the middle means the V is diagonal to one facing the same direction, a mark under the left leg means the V is facing the left leg of another V, and a mark under the right leg means the V is facing the right leg of another V. Assume left, right, up, and down are determined when the point of the V is facing this way: &uarr;.
