I worked with [WITCHES / The Coven Magazine](http://www.witchesofbushwick.com/) to create six data-driven patterns for a collaborative collection with [Print All Over Me](printallover.me). The patterns are driven by text and image data scraped from the first three issues of The Coven Magazine. View the full collection [here](printallover.me). Read more about the methodology behind each pattern below.

*Image*

This pattern represents an analysis of the RGB color space of every image in an issue. By mapping the normalized red, green, and blue pixel values of each photograph along a vertical continuum, the pattern forms a spectral profile representing the color distribution of pixels across a range of possible values. Each vertical group of cells encodes the percentage of pixels of a given channel as distributed across the 0-255 range. 


*Text*

This pattern represents the relative frequency and position of every alphabetic character in an issue. Comprised of cells in horizontal groups of four, it maps local and global occurrences of each letter to the individual pages on which they appear, generating a linear textual blueprint that supplants linguistic referentiality. The background of each cell in each group encodes the relative frequency of a given letter in comparison to the number of times it appears throughout the whole issue. The position of the smaller, solid square in each cell marks the relative frequency of the letter in each quadrant of the page in comparison to its total appearances on that page.
