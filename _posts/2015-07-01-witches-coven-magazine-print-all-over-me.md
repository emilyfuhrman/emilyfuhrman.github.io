A collaboration with [WITCHES / The Coven Magazine](http://www.witchesofbushwick.com/) to create six data-driven patterns for a collection with [Print All Over Me](http://printallover.me). Each one is generated using text and image data scraped from the first three issues of The Coven Magazine: white on black indicates a pattern driven by data from Issue 1, white on blue indicates a pattern driven by data from Issue 2, and black on white indicates a pattern driven by data from Issue 3. View the full collection [here](https://paom.com/collections/witches/). 

Patterns RGB-1, RGB-2, and RGB-3 map the normalized red, green, and blue pixel values of every image in each issue along a vertical continuum. Each column of cells encodes the percentage of pixels of a given channel as distributed across the 0-255 range.

Patterns TXT-1, TXT-2, and TXT-3 represent the relative frequency and position of the alphabetic characters in each issue. Comprised of cells in horizontal groups of four, each pattern maps local and global occurrences of every letter to the individual pages on which they appear, generating a linear textual blueprint that supplants linguistic referentiality. The background of each cell in each group encodes the relative frequency of a given letter in comparison to the number of times it appears throughout the whole issue. The position of the smaller, solid square in each cell marks the relative frequency of the letter in each quadrant of the page in comparison to its total appearances on that page.
