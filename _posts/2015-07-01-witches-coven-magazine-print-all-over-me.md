A collaboration with [WITCHES](https://web.archive.org/web/20150819102444/http://www.witchesofbushwick.com/) to create six data-driven patterns for a collection with [Print All Over Me](http://printallover.me). Each pattern is generated using text and image data scraped from the first three issues of The Coven Magazine. The full collection is available for purchase [here](https://paom.com/collections/witches/).
