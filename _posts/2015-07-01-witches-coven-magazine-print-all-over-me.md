A collaboration with [WITCHES](http://www.witchesofbushwick.com/) to create six data-driven patterns for a collection with [Print All Over Me](http://printallover.me). Each pattern is generated using text and image data scraped from the first three issues of The Coven Magazine: white on black indicates a pattern driven by data from Issue 1, white on blue indicates a pattern driven by data from Issue 2, and black on white indicates a pattern driven by data from Issue 3. The full collection is available for purchase [here](https://paom.com/collections/witches/).
