A portrayal of recurring sounds in the "Sirens" chapter of _Ulysses_. The implied musicality of this chapter, coupled with the mechanistic-if-it-were-not-intentional recurrence of certain words, renders it a legit candidate for graphic representation. The process of visualization is itself equal parts intentional and mechanistic, and when applied to text purportedly written in the style of a fugue, reveals a macro-level depiction of audible patterns otherwise lost in the linearity of the book.

The first 63 lines of “Sirens” form a kind of word-keyboard that introduces each prominent sound that will appear throughout the rest of the chapter. Through their juxtaposition and mutation, the sounds become [leitmotifs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitmotif) that evoke characters, relationships, dialogue, movement, or feeling.

This visualization is a line-by-line tracking of each word-sound that recurs at least four times following its initial introduction in the first 63 lines. There are 99 sounds total, and 1257 lines in the standard edition of the chapter. Each vertical column in the graphic represents a different word, and each horizontal line represents ten lines of text. Within each column, every dash is a mapped word, and the columns are clustered according to the character(s) they reference. I chose to highlight only six characters, mostly because I had way too much data and decided to focus on the more prominent ones. Diamond outlines count the number of times a keyword, a solid diamond, reappears within a single line. The visualization itself is proportionate on a line-by-line basis, and can theoretically be referenced alongside the text, if you're into that.

In order to be included, a root word (or syllable) had to appear five or more times throughout the entire chapter. And bonus invisible categories for those who are interested: "Secondary" words are either direct homophones of the root word, or semi-homophones related by co-occurrence throughout the chapter. "Tertiary" words are either words related only by association, or only semi-homophones.
