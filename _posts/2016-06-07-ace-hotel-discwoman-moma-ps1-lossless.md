Since it was founded, MoMA PS1 has created space for experimentation, play and cultural dialogue with emerging and established artists and musicians. This summer, Ace Hotel New York continues its sonic love affair with the institution’s music series, Warm Up. Now in its 19th year, Warm Up has become an icon of MoMA PS1's summer season, showcasing the best in experimental music and sound from around the globe.

Discwoman, a New York-based platform representing cis women, trans women and genderqueer talent often underrepresented in the electronic music mainstream, has several artists included in this year’s Warm Up lineup. MoMA PS1 has invited Discwoman to present Lossless — a solo exhibition of new works by visual artist Emily Fuhrman in Ace Hotel New York’s gallery. In this series, Fuhrman uses original code and unique conceptual constraints to produce data-driven 2D interpretations of selected tracks by artists featured in MoMA PS1's Warm Up series this year, including: “Queen” by TT The Artist; “Lionsong” by Bjork (Juliana Huxtable remix); BEARCAT’s score for Body Electric, the CHROMAT documentary; “Stillness” by SADAF, and “Homonyms” by Eartheater.

Presented by Ace Hotel New York and Discwoman in conjunction with Warm Up at MoMA PS1.
