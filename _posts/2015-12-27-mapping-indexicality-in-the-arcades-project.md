"Flânerie," Walter Benjamin observes, "can transform Paris into one great interior." Impelled by association, the flâneur embraces a form of acquiescence: to the tactile landscape impressing upon the attention, to the constellation of fragments flourishing in the consciousness, to the "far-off times and places [interpenetrating] the landscape and the present moment." The nature of this process is inexorably indexical, through which an arrangement of signs impels the liberation in the present of a series of recollections. From its trace emerges the subject, a combination of associations linked by memory, interiority, and spatiality.

This project interprets the text of _The Arcades Project_ as a collection of indexical gestures, reading instances of linguistic deixis as concretized moments of textual interiority. According to Charles Peirce, the word "this" is a certain type of index, which "calls upon the hearer to use his powers of observation, and so establish a real connection between his mind and the object." As a gesture within the text, the word "this" takes on a different kind of identity. Couched in a grammatical context, it becomes a marker of intratextual reference and a signifier of its own position. It embodies something close to a textual consciousness capable of remembering, anticipating, and referring to itself. 

Given the context-dependent meaning of deixis and the subjecthood implicit to its operation, this project endeavors to track every instance of the word "this" in _The Arcades Project_, classify the context of each instance along distinct spatial and temporal axes, and visually represent each convolute as a meandering path through time and space. The spatial movement evoked by the deictic instance, along with the temporal movement represented in linguistic modality and tense, forms the basis of each trajectory.

The resultant paths capture the wandering, associative nature of _The Arcades Project_ in a seemingly sporadic blueprint of its textual volition. Each traces a deliberate meandering that perhaps captures the ineffable progression of Benjamin’s prose&mdash;and, in a resonant manner, evokes a boundlessness and solitude.
