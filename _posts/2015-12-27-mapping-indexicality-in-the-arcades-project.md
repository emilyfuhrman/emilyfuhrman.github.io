This project interprets the text of Walter Benjamin's _The Arcades Project_[1] as a collection of gestures, reading instances of linguistic deixis as concretized moments of textual interiority. Each path represents the mutable indexicality of a given convolute by tracking the spatial and temporal context of the word "this." The resultant traces capture the wandering, associative nature of work in a seemingly sporadic blueprint of its textual volition. 

Built using Python and Processing.
