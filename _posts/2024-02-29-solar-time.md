A durational cyanotype exposure of sunbeams through the window of my London flat.

To produce this piece, I prepared a set of papers with light-sensitive cyanotype solution and arranged them on a west-facing wall. I exposed the papers to a period of sunlight, during which the beams visibly progressed &mdash; due, of course, to the apparent movement of the sun, which impressed upon the paper directly.

The work represents the passage of time as a visible duration, ambivalent to human operational abstractions (i.e. longitude, clock time). Fixing the interior on the surface of the earth, in relation to the sun, the visual effect is both intimate and celestial.
