// THE EVENT

A durational, gridded cyanotype exposure of sunbeams through the window.

// QUALITIES/PROCESS COMMON TO WHOLE EF BODY OF WORK

This piece is an outgrowth of mobilizing the interior as an analog data collection vehicle in the pursuit of indexing the self as the inhabitant of a specific place and time. Like other EF pieces, this one explores the process of collecting structured information using methods that extend beyond conventional data collection and analysis. Here, a physical rather than digital grid, with values impressed upon the paper directly. 

// HOW THESE WORKS WERE MADE

The grid of papers were prepared with light-sensitive cyanotype solution, and then arranged on a wall in the 6x3 grid depicted above. They were simultaneously exposed to thirty minutes of sunlight on 2024/02/01, from 12:46 to 13:16, during which the beams progressed along the wall due to the apparent movement of the sun [actual movement of the earth]. 

// WHAT THESE WORKS EVOKE/SUGGEST

This approach to personal data collection is at the same time intimate and celestial; it is a hyper-specific representation of the passage of time in a room in a London flat. It also places the position of the living space on earth, as a planet, and by extension the self, in relation to celestial bodies. It represents a way of measuring time independent of human abstractions, such as longitude or solar mean time. Instead, it portrays time as a progression experienced in the interior living space, mediated by a window. 

// VISUAL EFFECT AND CONCLUSIONS

The visual effect is both rigid and ephemeral.
