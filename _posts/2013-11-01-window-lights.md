A representation of building level vs. window brightness in Greenpoint around 7.30PM on a Saturday. Depicts the percentage of light showing through each window across the street from mine.

Each hexagon, or partial hexagon, is a window, and the number of sides divided by two represents the floor the window is on. The windows are ordered by amount of light blocked out -- taking into account curtains, or whether the lights were off -- with 0% starting in the top left corner, down to 100% (totally dark) in the bottom right corner. Percent darkness is represented by the partial hexagon fills that go whole around row five, at increments of ~16%. Original data [here](/images/post-015_imgs/window_data.txt).
